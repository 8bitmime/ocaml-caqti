(* Query Strings
 * =============
 *
 * Queries are normally registered in advance.  This allows Caqti to emit
 * prepared queries which are reused throughout the lifetime of the
 * connection.  The two most useful functions to do this are
 *
 *   - [prepare_sql] creates a query string which should work with all SQL
 *     databases of interest.
 *
 *   - [prepare_fun] creates a per-database query string.
 *
 * It's possible to avoid many dialect variation cases by using a function
 * which translates the placeholders for parameters, like [Q._q] defined in
 * [tests/test_sql_lwt.ml]. *)

(* Wrappers around the Generic Execution Functions
 * ===============================================
 *
 * Here we combine the above queries with a suitable execution function, for
 * convenience and to enforce type safety.  We could have defined these in a
 * functor on CONNECTION and used the resulting module in place of Db. *)

(* Db.exec runs a statement which must not return any rows.  Errors are
 * reported as exceptions. *)

let report_stolen (module Db : Caqti_lwt.CONNECTION_V2) frameno =
  Db.exec Q.report_stolen frameno

(* Db.find runs a query which must return at most one row.  The result is a
 * option, since it's common to seach for entries which don't exist. *)
let find_bike_owner frameno (module Db : Caqti_lwt.CONNECTION_V2) =
  Db.find_opt Q.select_frameno frameno

(* Db.iter_s iterates sequentially over the set of result rows of a query. *)
let iter_s_stolen (module Db : Caqti_lwt.CONNECTION_V2) f =
  Db.iter_s Q.select_stolen f ()

(* There is also a Db.iter_p for parallel processing, and Db.fold and
 * Db.fold_s for accumulating information from the result rows. *)
